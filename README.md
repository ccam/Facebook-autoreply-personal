# Facebook away message

Auto replies to all messages sent to your personal profile. I want to add a exclued list instead of just one converstaion, thats for personal use. 

# Set up

```shell
npm install
```

You will need to make a json file named creds.json or just insert your email and password into the email and password variables. 

```json
{
  "user" : {
      "email" : "dankmaster6969696@rocketmail.pizza",
      "password" : "Password123!"
  }
}

```
